  Formalization of: Feinstein C.A., "The Collatz 3n+1 Conjecture is Unprovable",
  Global Journal of Science Frontier Research, Mathematics & Decision 
  Sciences, Volume 12, Issue 8, (2012) 13-15, arXiv:math/0312309 (2003)


  GOAL: Prove the Collatz conjecture is unprovable using algorithmic information theory.
  
  STRATEGY: Show any finite proof p cannot verify Collatz for all numbers because:
  1. Proofs must encode computational traces (parity vectors)
  2. Some parity vectors are incompressible (Kolmogorov-random)
  3. A finite proof cannot contain arbitrarily long incompressible strings
  
  This adapts Chaitin's approach to Gödel's incompleteness theorem.

  The "shortcut" Collatz map combines odd steps:
  * even step:  n ↦ n div 2
  * odd step:   n ↦ (3*n + 1) div 2
  
  KEY INSIGHT: We record the computational trace as a "parity vector" - 
  a binary string recording which iterates are odd/even.

  CRITICAL LEMMA: The parity vector uniquely determines an affine formula:
    T^k(n) = (3^s * n + c) / 2^k
  where s counts the odd steps.
  
  This means parity vectors are INJECTIVE on fixed length - knowing the formula
  (k,s,c) tells you the exact parity sequence.

  KEY TECHNICAL LEMMA: Adding multiples of 2^k to n preserves the first k parity bits.
  
  INTUITION: If two numbers differ by 2^k, they have the same parity. After applying T,
  the difference becomes a multiple of 2^(k-1), so by induction the property persists.
  
  This is the heart of why we can CONSTRUCT numbers with prescribed parity vectors.

  MAIN CONSTRUCTION: For ANY binary string x, we can find n with parity_vec n (length x) = x.
  
  PROOF SKETCH:
  * Base case (even bit): Take n = 2*m where m realizes the tail
  * Inductive case (odd bit): Adjust m by adding t*2^ℓ (for small t ≤ 2) to ensure
    m ≡ 2 (mod 3), then take n such that T(n) = m
  
  The modular arithmetic ensures we can always find an odd predecessor.

  MAIN THEOREM: No finite proof can verify Collatz for all numbers.
  
  PROOF: Suppose p is a finite proof of length L.
  1. Take a random (incompressible) string s of length L+1
  2. By realizability, some n has parity_vec n (L+1) = s
  3. By unboundedness, p must prove T^k(n)=1 for some k ≥ L+1
  4. Therefore p must contain s (the parity vector)
  5. But s is incompressible, so |p| ≥ L+1
  6. Contradiction: L ≥ L+1
