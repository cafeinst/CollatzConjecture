  We use the "shortcut" Collatz map:

  One application of T always halves once (either immediately or after adding 1).

section ‹Affine parameters induced by a parity vector›

text ‹
  Consuming the parity vector from right to left, we accumulate parameters (c,s) with:
    T^k(n) = (3^s * n + c) div 2^k,
  where s is the number of odd steps among the first k iterates.
  This fold is injective on fixed length, so the affine "formula" (k,s,c) determines the parity vector.

  If two naturals differ by a multiple of 2^k, they have the same first k parity bits.
  Intuition: equal mod 2 ⇒ same parity; after applying T once, the difference
  remains a multiple of 2^{k-1}, so we can iterate.
