  Formalization inspired by: Feinstein C.A., "The Collatz 3n+1 Conjecture is Unprovable",
  arXiv:math/0312309 (2003)

  GOAL: Prove the Collatz conjecture is unprovable using algorithmic information theory.
  
  STRATEGY: Show any finite proof p cannot verify Collatz for all numbers because:
  1. Proofs must encode computational traces (parity vectors)
  2. Some parity vectors are Kolmogorov-random (incompressible)
  3. A finite proof cannot contain arbitrarily long incompressible encodings
  
  This adapts Chaitin's approach to Gödel's incompleteness theorem.

  MAIN CONSTRUCTION: For ANY binary string x, we can find n with parity_vec n (length x) = x.
  
  PROOF SKETCH:
  * Base case (even bit): Take n = 2*m where m realizes the tail
  * Inductive case (odd bit): Adjust m by adding t*2^ℓ (for small t ≤ 2) to ensure
    m ≡ 2 (mod 3), then take n such that T(n) = m
  
  The modular arithmetic ensures we can always find an odd predecessor.

  KEY CHANGE: We no longer assume enc_parity = id.
  
  Instead, we use Kolmogorov complexity: a parity vector s with K(s) ≥ m
  cannot be encoded in fewer than m bits by ANY encoding (including enc_parity).
  
  This makes the proof robust against clever encoding schemes.
