CollatzConjecture contains a Isabelle/HOL theory file formalizing conditional results related to information-theoretic limitations of certain proof strategies for the Collatz conjecture.

The development makes explicit assumptions about the class of admissible proof methods and proves statements only within those assumptions.

The formalization is based on ideas from the paper:
Craig Alan Feinstein, “The Collatz 3n+1 Conjecture is Unprovable,” arXiv:math/0312309.
