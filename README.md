Collatz_Information_Barriers contains an Isabelle/HOL theory file formalizing
conditional results related to information-theoretic limitations of certain
proof strategies for the Collatz conjecture.

The development makes explicit assumptions about the class of admissible proof
methods and proves statements only within those assumptions.

The formalization is based on ideas from the paper:
Craig Alan Feinstein, “The Collatz 3n+1 Conjecture is Unprovable,”
arXiv:math/0312309.
